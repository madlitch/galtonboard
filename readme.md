## How to use

To use this app, you can either compile from src or run the .jar file in out.
Input the number of balls to be dropped and the number of bins at the bottom, then click start.
This will give you a visual representation of the standard normal distribution created by a Galton Board.

## Why it was made 

Final project for a Data Structures course, using recursion and data structures to optimize speed and efficiency.
